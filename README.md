I chose **The GRI VROV Simulator - Virtual Remotely Operated Vehicle**, which is a training tool that replicates the operation of ROVs in underwater environments.
It provides realistic visuals and physics, allowing users to practice navigating, manipulating robotic arms, and handling challenging conditions like currents and limited visibility.
This simulator helps operators improve their skills in a safe, controlled setting, making real-life missions safer and more efficient. It's widely used in industries like offshore oil, marine research, and underwater maintenance.
